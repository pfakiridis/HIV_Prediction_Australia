# HIV_Patient_Prediction_Australia
The dataset for this project is called Aids2ann and contains annualized data on patients diagnosed with
AIDS in Australia before 1 July 2001. The scope of the project is to use logistic regression to establish which variables affect the outcome, i.e. how likely for a particular patient to die in a particular year. The analysis usses logistic regression to find patterns in the data as well as ways to evaluate the performance of the logistic regression and to choose the appropriate model.
